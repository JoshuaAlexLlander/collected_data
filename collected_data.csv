The COVID19 vaccine symptoms reported through VAERS do not determine causality. The US CDC still recommends COVID19 vaccination for pregnant women.,1
Medical experts widely concur that the COVID19 vaccines are humanitys best hope for ending the pandemic.,1
"The graph came from a private organization that is not affiliated with VAERS. According to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC, VAERS had received 7,899 reports of death among COVID19 vaccinated people as of September 20. These reports from VAERS alone cannot be used to prove that the vaccines caused the deaths.",1
COVID19 vaccines do not work the way they were described in the video where the claim came from. They are not used to track or identify people.,1
"The Nuremberg Code is a World War IIera guideline that is not followed by the medical field in modern times and is not legally binding. It also does not apply to COVID19 vaccination, because vaccines had already passed several stages of clinical trials before being allowed to be given to the public.",1
"The spike protein, in the absence of the other parts of the virus, is not enough to function like a live SARSCoV2 and infect you or other people. There is no evidence that the spike protein by itself can harm the body. There is also no evidence that you will shed the spike protein in substantial amounts after getting vaccinated.",1
"Pfizers COVID19 vaccine does not contain HIV particles, according to a fact sheet by the US Food and Drug administration FDA, a document from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC, and the Philippine Department of Health DOH.",1
"Animal testing was done for the COVID19 vaccines by Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson  Johnson, each of which has emergency use authorization EUA in the US. It was also done for the AstraZeneca and Novavax vaccines.",1
"There was no Senate bill on this. There is House Bill No. 9252, which calls for mandatory vaccination against COVID19, but this has not yet been transmitted to the Senate as it is pending with the House committee on health.",1
"The article did not take into consideration the age of the patients who died age is a significant factor in COVID19 deaths. Although it is true that3,284 out of 4,135 COVID19 deaths were among fullyvaccinated patients,3,081 of them are aged 60 and older.",1
Facts Bourla is fully vaccinated. He received his second PfizerBioNTech COVID19 vaccine dose in March 2021. He did not get vaccinated sooner since he did not want to be an example of cutting the line.,1
"As of Tuesday, May 18, 2021, there is no evidence that COVID19 vaccines can cause infertility. Health experts like The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and government health departments like the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Australian Department of Health say that people who plan to become pregnant in the future may receive the COVID19 vaccine.",1
"Worldrecognized and leading health experts say that mass vaccination programs remain to be the most effective way of stopping the rapid mutations and spread of COVID19. While breakthrough infections can still happen among fully vaccinated individuals, the rate of transmitting the virus to others is much lower.",1
The videos shown are of TikTok users participating in a viral magnet test challenge. Experts have also said vaccine doses are too small and therefore not strong enough to cause magnetic reactions.,1
"Dover is alive, according to CHI Memorial hospital, her place of work. She has also explained that she fainted after receiving the vaccine because of an underlying health condition.",1
"DMX died after suffering a heart attack, while Larry King died due to sepsis. There are no reports they received the COVID19 vaccines prior to their deaths.",1
"Germanys federal institute for vaccines says all deaths were seriously ill patients, and finds no causal relationship to vaccination.",1
"While COVID19 vaccines may cause side effects, they are not designed to teach the immune system to kill the body.",1
RNA vaccines do not alter DNA. The messenger RNA from the vaccine is eventually destroyed by the bodys cells after they read its sequence.,1
The Department of Health DOH debunked the post and called it fake. There is no such institution called Beijing Vaccine Prevention Center. The local health authorities in the Chinese capital are the Beijing Center for Disease Prevention and Control and the Beijing Municipal Health Commission.,1
"Although mRNA vaccines work differently than traditional vaccines, various studies showed that they are effective against the coronavirus disease or COVID19. Health experts also say mRNA vaccines are safe.",1
"As of Friday, April 30, there is no proof that the deaths of the elderly who received the COVID19 vaccine are linked to the vaccine.",1
"Individuals who experience adverse side effects due to COVID19 vaccines remain to be the rare cases, affecting only 1 in 100,000 for AstraZeneca and only 1 in 122,000 for Johnson  Johnson.",1
"The vaccines do not contain harmful metalbased preservatives, according to the ingredients lists released by vaccine manufacturers.",1
The Facts The San Pedro local government unit LGU had announced that vaccine supply allocated for Category A4 individuals were out of stock. Vaccinations for individuals in other categories were carried out.,1
"The website containing this claim cites EudraVigilance, an EUmaintained database of selfreported adverse effects after COVID19 vaccination. However, EudraVigilance says its database contains reports of events following COVID19 vaccination that are not necessarily related to or caused by the vaccines.",1
Reports say that Pfizer and BioNTech temporarily cut their EU deliveries because of improvements to their production site in the Belgian town of Puurs. It was not mentioned in the reports if it was due to any side effects of the vaccine.,1
"While there is a possibility of blood clotting following vaccination of AstraZenecas coronavirus vaccine, studies show these cases are very rare. Health experts worldwide have concluded that the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks.",1
"This figure was published by the CDC, but it only referred to those who reported side effects through the Vsafe mobile app. It did not reflect the total number of vaccine recipients in the US or the total number of people who experienced side effects due to the vaccine.",1
COVID19 vaccines went through three phases of clinical testing before being approved by the Philippines Food and Drug Administration.,1
Cases and deaths related to COVID19 continue to get recorded globally. A coronavirus vaccine can create immunity against the virus.,1
There is no proof or official reports that Gates created SarsCoV2. Moderna is a publicly traded company and is owned by many shareholders.,1
"Various studies have shown that COVID19 vaccines are effective against the disease. More than three million people worldwide died of the disease, but there have been no reports of death proven to be directly linked to the vaccines.",1
"The health department has authorized the use of COVID19 booster shots for everyone aged 18 or older since December 2, 2021",1
"The towns health chief refuted the claim. Moreover, the Department of Health reports zero deaths caused by COVID19 vaccines, as of August 16.",1
"A number of experts and health organizations have deemed the COVID19 vaccines being released as safe and effective, including the World Health Organization, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Johns Hopkins Medicine, and the Philippine Department of Health.",1
China delivered COVID19 vaccines to Cambodia via military plane on February 7.,1
The role of teachers in vaccination teams will be for health education only. The vaccination itself will be done by health professionals.,1
"The video shows an experiment on selfassembling wires, which was originally uploaded to YouTube in 2015. The Department of Health also says COVID19 vaccines do not contain any material that can alter a persons genetic material.",1
"The video does not prove that Bluetooth can detect vaccinated individuals. The detected codes shown in the video are consistent with the formatting of Media Access Control MAC addresses, which are used for Bluetooth.",1
"The study cited in the video has been previously debunked. Both the UK and the US have monitoring systems for COVID19 vaccines adverse effects. These use selfreporting methods in recording cases, which means reported events are not always proven side effects, and some events may have happened anyway, regardless of vaccination. The agencies in charge of these systems say that the actual number of cases may be lower than what is reported.",1
Viral shedding can only occur when a vaccine contains a weakened version of the virus. mRNA vaccines do not use a live virus that causes COVID19.,1
The Department of Health has instituted a digital platform where health facilities can upload information on individuals whom they have vaccinated. It doesnt have to collect vaccination cards to copy the information contained in these. The National Privacy Commission has also advised that data collected in vaccination cards must abide by the Data Privacy Act.,1
"COVID19 vaccines cannot do anything to subatomic particles like the Higgs Boson particle, the official name of the what is known as the God Particle, due to the limitations of the laws of physics.",1
"The clip came from Dutertes Talk to the People that aired on September 30, 2021, when booster shots were not yet authorized in the Philippines. Duterte has since encouraged the public to get vaccinated with booster shots after it was approved by health authorities in December 2021. Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles also said that the circulating clip should be viewed in the proper context.",1
"None of the COVID19 vaccines contain parasitic eggs nor any parasitic materials. Vaccines typically contain an antigen that teaches our immune system to identify the virus and fight against it, as well as chemicals that maintain the integrity of the vaccines.",1
"There is no such thing as a vaccination exemption card that is authorized, issued, or recognized by the Philippine government.",1
"The video was taken from a dated news report, and the DOH has since encouraged those eligible to get COVID19 booster shots.",1
"The government is currently in the initial phase of vaccine rollout with the availability of Sinovac, AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Sputnik V, and Janssen vaccines in the country. Likewise, the country is in the advanced stages of negotiations with the COVAX Facility and various other vaccine manufacturers.",1
The national government is working in partnership with our local governments to get the vaccines to you. Your local government unit will arrange for the registration and scheduling of vaccination,1
"The prioritization framework for COVID19 vaccination based on the World Health Organization WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts SAGE on Immunization, together with the recommendations of independent bodies of experts including the Interim National Immunization Technical Advisory Group iNITAG and the Technical Advisory Group TAG, was formulated due to the limited global supply of COVID19 vaccine products. With the guidance of this principle, the Philippine National Deployment and Vaccination Plan formulated strategies and contingencies to ensure the equitable distribution of vaccine products for all Filipinos.",1
"With the initial limited supply, frontline health workers and uniformed personnel are prioritized since they have higher risk of exposure while on duty and to allow them to continue fulfilling their duties in both the public and private sectors. Vulnerable groups such as the elderly and the indigent population, are prioritized guided by the principle of equity.",1
Frontline workers in health facilities including nonprofessionals like students in health and allied professions courses with clinical responsibilities are part of Vaccination Priority Group A.,1
"Frontline workers in health facilities including nonhealthcare professionals like ambulance staff, janitors, administrative staff, etc. are part of Priority Group A.",1
The cost of vaccines for priority groups will be shouldered by the Philippine government.,1
"The objective is to provide equitable access to safe and effective COVID19 vaccines to the priority eligible groups or almost 70 million Filipinos by 2021, 6070% of Filipinos by 2022, and followed by the remaining Filipino population in the next three 3 years.",1
"The Government plans to vaccinate all eligible Filipinos for free, starting with 50 to 70 million in 2021. Eligibility would depend on the vaccines available, specifications for their allowable use, as well as scope of use authorized by our Philippine FDA.",1
Commercialization of vaccines with EUA is not yet allowed under relevant FDA issuances.,1
"This will depend on the vaccine. For those currently available, Sinovac can be given to clinically healthy individuals 18 to 59 years old, while AstraZeneca can be given to those 18 years old and above, including senior citizens.",1
"Results from Phase II and Phase III trials of COVID19 vaccines are currently insufficient for the pediatric age group 18 yrs old, limiting health experts from formulating any recommendations. Further studies will help in the future inclusion of children for vaccination.",1
Vaccines mimic the virus or bacteria that causes disease and triggers the bodys creation of antibodies. These antibodies will provide protection once a person is infected with the actual diseasecausing virus or bacteria.,1
"Vaccines differ in their composition and how they trigger the immune response to create antibodies. These antibodies protect the body from microorganisms and serve as protection once a person gets infected with disease. Vaccines can be inactivated, weakened or killed copies of the whole or part of the virus or bacteria, or genetic product like mRNA vaccines that creates protein copies without causing disease.",1
"The possible side effects of a vaccine include pain, redness, itchiness or swelling at the injection site which may last a few hours fever feeling of weakness or fatigue headache dizziness diarrhea or nausea. Consult the nearest healthcare professional if you experience any of these.",1
vaccination is not mandatory. But the government highly encourages the public to get vaccinated and be protected against preventable disease.,1
"With the BIDA steps and observance of minimum public health standards, vaccination is an important way to protect yourself from getting severe COVID19.",1
he government is currently in the advanced stages of negotiations with various vaccine manufacturers. We expect the first vaccine supply to arrive in the first quarter of 2021.,1
"Emergency Use Authorization EUA is an authorization granted through a riskbased procedure for assessing unregistered under development vaccines or drugs during public health emergencies of international concern. It aims to expedite availability of the vaccine or drug to people affected by public health emergency based on essential set of available quality, safety and efficacy performance data.",1
"Frontline health workers, senior citizens, indigent population, and uniformed personnel are the priority groups to be vaccinated.",1
"you cannot purchase COVID19 vaccines from private clinics or pharmacies. At present, only the government is duly authorized to procure and administer vaccines. Until a full market authorization is issued by the Philippine FDA, any COVID19 vaccine should not be sold to the public.",1
"The government is continuing negotiations to ensure adequate vaccine supply for all Filipinos, including those not in the priority groups.",1
COVID19 vaccines that are granted with Emergency Use Authorization EUA by the Food and Drug Administration FDA are considered safe and effective based on the available evidence to date.,1
"like all other vaccines, there are risks of complications BUT SEVERE OR LIFETHREATENING REACTIONS ARE EXTREMELY RARE. The benefit of protection against severe COVID19 is greater than the risk. Anyone who will get the vaccine will be properly evaluated and closely monitored by health professionals to further minimize any risk.",1
"People with history of bleeding disorders or taking blood thinners, asthma, and has allergy to food, egg, or medicine are eligible to get the COVID19 vaccine but with special precautions.",1
"People currently diagnosed with COVID19 or with symptoms of fever  chills, fatigue, cough, colds, headache, sore throat, myalgia, loss of taste or smell, diarrhea, shortness of breath  difficulty breathing, and rashes are eligible to take the COVID19 vaccine but will be subject for rescheduling.",1

"Patients with cancer and who are currently, or will be undergoing active chemotherapy may be vaccinated any time before andor during chemotherapy sessions, if they have no other contraindications to the vaccine.",1
"For those who are undergoing Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation HCT or Cellular Therapy, they should delay vaccination for at least 3 months after transplantation or therapy.",1
People with wellcontrolled comorbidities can get the vaccines. These people may have an increased risk of getting severe COVID19 and may benefit from the protection provided by the vaccines.,1
"Breastfeeding women can receive a COVID19 vaccine. However, Gamaleya vaccine shall not be administered to the pregnant and breastfeeding populations. The World Health Organization states that if a breastfeeding woman is part of a group recommended for vaccination for example, healthcare workers, vaccination can be offered. It is not recommended to discontinue breastfeeding before or after vaccination.",1
"Pregnancy is not a contraindication to getting the COVID19 vaccine. Pregnant women can get the vaccine with precaution, given that there is limited data on pregnant women from clinical studies. ",1
"If a pregnant woman is part of a group recommended for vaccination, vaccination can be offered. It is advised to get the vaccine after the 1st trimester of pregnancy.",1
Those planning to get pregnant may get the COVID19 vaccine.,1

"vaccines can protect you from getting symptomatic mild, moderate, and severe COVID19. Further, it can prevent hospitalization and death from the disease",1
the reports of people dying were of people who died DUE TO COVID19 and not because of the vaccine.,1
There was no relation between getting vaccinated and the reported deaths due to COVID19,1
"Even if the vaccine protects from symptomatic, and moderate to severe forms of COVID19, you can add protection by doing the BIDA Bawal walang mask at face shield, Isanitize ang mga kamay, Dumistansya ng isang metrong layo, Alamin ang tamang impormasyon behaviors.",1
"local reactions like pain, redness, and swelling at the injection site and flulike symptoms including fever, headache, and fatigue are common after vaccination. These are signs that your body is building up the immune response from the vaccine. These symptoms will resolve in one to three days.",1
"If your symptoms got worse or did not resolve within 3 days, consult your doctor or nearest facility if they dont resolve after 3 days, or if they worsen after one day.",1
"Even if youve already received your first dose of the COVID19 vaccine, you can prevent the spread of the virus to your family and community by staying at home unless travel is essential, open windows and ensure proper ventilation and air circulation at home or your place of work, maintain a balanced and healthy diet, exercise, and avoid smoking and alcohol, and monitor your health and call your Barangay Health Emergency Response Team if you have symptoms AND POSSIBLE EXPOSURE TO THE VIRUS.",1
"Vaccination is not mandatory and anyone may opt to decline.

"The prioritization framework for COVID19 vaccination based on the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts SAGE on Immunization, together with the recommendations of independent bodies of experts including the Interim National Immunization Technical Advisory Group iNITAG and the Technical Advisory Group TAG, was formulated due to the limited global supply of COVID19 vaccine products. With the guidance of this principle, the Philippine National Deployment and Vaccination Plan formulated strategies and contingencies to ensure the equitable distribution of vaccine products for all Filipinos.",1
The Philippine Food and Drug Administration FDA is the governments regulatory body for all medicines in the country. Information regarding products including vaccines may be accessed at the FDA website at httpswww.fda.gov.ph. It shall continuously provide advisories to the public based on their monitoring of products in the market. ,1
Intensified vaccine information campaigns and risk communication strategies are also presently in place to protect the public from misinformation.,1
RTPCR testing for COVID19 is not required prior to vaccine administration.,1
"Based on the Philippine FDA EUA of available vaccines here in the Philippines, occurrence of anaphylactic reaction after the 1st dose of COVID19 vaccine is not advised for the inoculation of the 2nd dose of that vaccine type. Additionally, interchangeability of vaccine products is not recommended due to limited availability of scientific evidence.",1
"At the screening area, the personnel assigned shall scan the individual's QR or Unique Code before they are clinically assessed for COVID19 symptoms, comorbidities, and other important clinical information. Contraindications and precautions stated in the EUA issued by the Philippine FDA shall be followed for all vaccines.",1
"Specific health screening e.g. age, allergy to vaccine components may be adopted per vaccine and shall be issued in vaccinespecific guidelines. Likewise, health screening shall follow clinical practice guidelines of medical societies, which shall be regularly updated based on best available evidence.",1
"Using both the VIMS Vaccination Post System VPS and hard copy of the screening form, health workers shall update the profile of potential vaccine recipients and determine whether or not they are eligible for vaccination.",1
"Individuals not belonging to special populations, like those who are immunodeficient or senior citizens with special conditions i.e. bedridden, in vegetative state, with limited life expectancy, may have their health profiling, provision of informed consent, and screening on the same day of vaccination. Otherwise, they shall first obtain medical clearance from their attending physicians to discuss vaccinespecific risks and benefits.",1
"Implementing unitsare those allowed to conduct vaccination activities. These are the following a hospitals, medical centers, infirmaries, b rural health units, c private clinics, and d health facilities of government agencies.",1
"In designing local mechanisms of monitoring, LVOCs shall follow the minimum frequency of prompts or followup from the vaccine one 1 week, two 2 weeks, one 1 month, three 3 months, six 6 months, and twelve 12 months after the date of vaccination. LVOCs may use more frequent intervals of monitoring depending on their capacity and agreements with the vaccination sites.",1
"The government will have an indemnification fund for all those who will experience adverse effects or events following immunization. In cases of severe AEFIs, costs for hospitalization or management and treatment of the adverse events will be shouldered by the government through PhilHealth. PhilHealth coverage of hospitalization shall be in accordance with the rules and regulations of the National Health Insurance Program.",1
"An Adverse Event Following Immunization AEFI is any of the following that may arise after vaccination unfavourable or unintended sign andor symptom, abnormal laboratory finding, or disease that may arise after immunization. An AEFI may not necessarily be caused by the vaccine.",1
"LGUs and vaccination sites shall provide postvaccination reminders and home instructions to all vaccine recipients through handouts or SMSbased reminders that shall include mechanisms to report any adverse event after immunization to the vaccination site or the LGU, initial treatment or management for common adverse events, and contact information or location for consultations or referrals. Sample postvaccination reminders are available at bit.lyRESBAKUNAMaterials",1
Patients with comorbidities belong to groups that may have an increased risk of getting severe COVID19 if infected and would thus benefit from the protection immunization offers. The currently available vaccines in the country may be administered to individuals who have wellcontrolled comorbidities.,1
"all individuals who contracted COVID19 may be vaccinated after recovery or completion of treatment, whether for first or second dose, without restarting the vaccine dose schedule.",1
"Only vaccines which have finished the phase 4 clinical trials are provided a Certificate of Product Registration CPR which would allow the vaccines to be commercially available. To date, most of the vaccines are still in Phase 3, hence, the purchase of vaccines must be done through the tripartite agreement with the national government and manufacturers.",1
"Proof of comorbidity may be any of the following medical certificate from attending physician, prescription for medicines, hospital records such as discharge summary, medical abstract, surgical records, pathology reports, or any other proof that may indicate eligibility for priority group A3. Proofs of comorbidity do not need to indicate that the comorbidity is controlled to be eligible for vaccination.",1
"All Filipinos, including OFWs, and other groups with legal residency status in the Philippines i.e. foreign nationals, diplomats, etc. shall be included in the priority group appropriate to their circumstance. For example, said individuals meeting the eligibility criteria for priority group A2 senior citizens or A3 adults with controlled comorbidities may masterlist with their respective LGUs subject to supply availability.",1
"All Filipinos shall indicate their interest to be vaccinated through their respective LGUs based on the address of their permanent or current residence or workplace. For other groups under eligible populations, detailed guidelines shall be developed and disseminated accordingly.",1
"AstraZeneca, Gamaleya Sputnik V, Janssen, and Bharat BioTech can also be given to those 18 years old and above, including senior citizens.",1
"As of May 5, 2021, the Philippine FDA has issued an EUA to the PfizerBioNTech, AztraZeneca Pharmaceuticals, Sinovac, Gamaleya Sputnik V, Johnson and Johnsons Janssen, Bharat BioTechs Covaxin, and Moderna COVID19 vaccines. The FDA continues to accept applications for EUA.",1
"Philippine's current vaccine portfolio consists of eight vaccines  PfizerBioNTech, Oxford AstraZeneca, Sinovac CoronaVac, Gamaleya Sputnik V, Bharat BioTech, Moderna, Novavax, and Janssen. As of May 5, 2021, Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Sinovac, Sputnik V, JJs Janssen, Bharat BioTechs Covaxin, and Moderna have been issued an Emergency Use Authorization EUA by the Philippine FDA.",1
The FDA will continuously monitor the vaccines being used in the vaccination program. FDA inspectors shall regularly conduct market surveillance to safeguard from unauthorized use of vaccines.,1
"Currently, the Philippines does not have the capacity to develop and manufacture its own vaccines. To ensure adequate supply of COVID19 vaccines for all Filipinos, the country banks on a combined effort in procuring vaccine doses, participating in Phase 3 clinical trials, and participating in multilateral negotiations such as the COVAX Facility.",1
"The Government estimates that it will spend an average composite cost of around PHP 1,300.00 per person for the vaccination program. This includes vaccine cost assuming a twodose requirement and ancillaries.",1
"The private sector can only procure vaccines through a tripartite agreement with the NTF and the Department of Health, as DOH is the EUA holder of these vaccines. Private companies will be advised by the iNITAG on which sector should be prioritized. LIkewise, the private sector needs to partner with a vaccination site that follows the standars described in the NVDP.",1
"The same brand is required to be given for a 2nd dose, to ensure the maximum protection of the vaccinee. The DOH is coordinating with the Local Government Units to ensure allocation of adequate doses of the same Philippine FDAapproved vaccine brand.",1
"The government will make sure that those given with 1st dose will also be given their second dose on time. For example, if we have 50,000 doses available, we will only vaccinate the 25,000 eligible population to make sure that they will be given their second doses accordingly.",1
"The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC allow for a 4day grace period when assessing ontime receipt. People should try to get the second dose during this period or as soon after as possible. However, if the second dose is given later than this, you do not need to restart the vaccine. You still only need to get the second dose. However, it is important to note that the first dose did not protect as many people as were protected after the second dose, so if you are exposed to SARSCoV2 during the delay, you may or may not have enough immunity to prevent you from experiencing symptoms.",1
Vaccine cold chain refers to the maintenance of the vaccines product quality from the time it is manufactured until the point of administration by ensuring that vaccines are stored and transported within WHOrecommended temperature ranges.,1
"A vaccine is a biological product. If it gets too hot or too cold, the active ingredients can degrade and become less effective.",1
"Once a dose of vaccine is manufactured, it needs to be transported to immunization programs and clinics and health centers all over the world, and then remain viable until its needed.",1
"From the national central cold storage facility, vaccines will be delivered to the regional hubs  Centers for Health Development CHDs and identified provinces and cities with direct flight schedule. From the CHDs, the vaccines will be delivered to provinces and cities, or to preidentified vaccination sites   Rural Health Units RHUs, Main Health Centers, and hospitals within their catchment areas.",1
"The DOH will coordinate with the appropriate authorities and with the LGUs to identify which air and sea ports will be involved in delivery of the vaccines. Vaccines allocated for all regions in Visayas and Mindanao, and in selected provinces in Luzon will be delivered by air. The remaining allocation for Luzon will be delivered by refrigerated vans.",1
"COVID19 vaccines have different recommended temperature requirements and the deployment plan is ready for the possible requirements of different vaccines  a refrigerated 2C to 8C, b frozen 15C to 25C, and c ultracold 70C to 80C.",1
"Specific guidelines for the implementation of vaccine storage, handling, and transfer shall be in line with the corresponding EUA provisions issued by the Philippine FDA for each vaccine. Cold chain management requirements shall be maintained from manufacturing, storage, and distribution of vaccines to ensure integrity of vaccine compounds.",1
"All vaccines shall be inspected by the DOH Inspection and Acceptance Committee upon arrival at the main warehouse facility prior to distribution to vaccination sites to ensure that the vaccines are of good quality upon arrival, full documentary requirements are present, and recommended storage temperatures are maintained.",1
"To prepare the country for the COVID19 vaccination program, a masterlist will 1 provide basis for identification of target eligible groups for vaccination and identification of priority areas for registration of eligible individuals 2 ensure uniqueness of individuals in the vaccine administration plan and 3 provide input to operational planning especially for costing and allocation of resources.",1
"The COVID19 Vaccine Information Management System  Immunization Registry VIMSIR shall be the official platform for masterlisting and preregistration of individuals for COVID19 vaccination. The VIMS platform shall also enable use of information and communications technology for scheduling, notification, and vaccination reminders.",1
The Vaccine Information Management System  Immunization Registry VIMSIR is used only for masterlisting and as the registry of eligible population. Health facilities and vaccination centers upload their data or linelist of those who were vaccinated to the VIMS  Vaccine Administration System VAS.,1
DOH will have central access to all of this data including those that are vaccinated. It is stored centrally at DICT. DOH CHDs have been given access to their appropriate data.,1
All Filipinos will need to be masterlisted with their full health profile prior to vaccination. But the first phase will involve all frontline health workers in the public and private sector. The schedule of masterlisting will be consistent with the ordering of prioritization in the National Vaccine Deployment Plan.,1
"Information that will be collected prior to masterlisting will be personal information, such as but not limited to full name, birthday, and PhilHealth Identification Number PIN, shall be collected to ensure no doubling of identified potential vaccine recipients. Health data will also be collected to help the vaccination team identify and verify which priority group the individual belongs to and assess the person's eligibility for the vaccine.",1
"The LGU or zones will determine the scheduling for vaccination. The Vaccine Information Management System VIMS platform shall be used for scheduling, notifying, and reminding individuals of their scheduled vaccination.",1
"All potential vaccine recipients must present any governmentissued identification card, such as PRC license, driver's license, UMID, PhilHealth ID, or passport. In case individual does not have a government ID with photo, any other government document, such as cedula, barangay certificate, or birth certificate may be presented.",1
"Local government units LGUs are in charge of masterlisting or profiling. For other groups under eligible populations, detailed guidelines shall be developed and disseminated accordingly.",1
WHO defines efficacy as reduction in disease incidence in a vaccinated group compared to an unvaccinated group under optimal conditions such as in a randomized clinical trial.,1
"For COVID19 vaccine trials, the primary endpoint  is the occurrence of symptomatic COVID19 but they are also measuring other endpoints such as severe COVID, hospitalization due to COVID.",1
No vaccine provides 100% protection from COVID19. It typically takes a few weeks for the body to build immunity after vaccination. That means it is possible a person could be infected with the virus that causes COVID19 just before or just after vaccination and still get sick because the vaccine has not had enough time to provide protection.,1
"efficacy is measured not only by a vaccine's ability to prevent infection, but also in its prevention of severe forms of the disease and of forward transmission. While a vaccinated person  may not be completely prevented from getting infected, she will still have a reduced risk of getting severe forms of COVID19. If more people have this reduced risk, then we can more effectively reduce transmission.",1
"Due to the relatively short observation period for Phase 3 trials, the actual duration of immunity that the vaccines provide is currently unknown. This is still being determined through continuous monitoring of the vaccine recipients in the trials. Until this is established, we must continue practicing minimum public health standardsBIDA behaviors  bawal walang face mask at face shield, isanitize ang kamay, dumistansya ng isang metro, at alamin ang tamang impormasyon.",1
The presence of antibodies can be documented using antibody tests but this is not a requirement postvaccination and is not recommended based on current evidence particularly for mRNA vaccines.,1
"Emerging data seems to suggest that the current vaccines protect against the new variants. However, definitive studies are still under way to determine whether the vaccines currently being used will protect against the new variants.",1
"A small in vitro study showed that antibodies from people given the BNT162b2 Pfizer vaccine were able to neutralize SARSCoV2 variants with the N501Y mutation this was not the UK variant B.1.1.7, which had more mutations. It seems very likely that the other vaccines will result in the same findings, based on expert opinion.",1
"All vaccine recipients who contracted COVID19 may be vaccinated after recovery or completion of treatment, whether for first or second dose, without restarting the vaccine dose schedule.",1
"Vaccines are some of the most rigorously tested medical products today, and the COVID19 vaccines are no different. The fact that the COVID19 vaccines are available for use less than a year since the virus was discovered was not because corners were cut in the conduct of the clinical trials.",1
"the technology used to make the vaccines are the result of years of basic science research and experience with other outbreaks, as well as the continuous advancement in science and technology. All the vaccines which underwent Phase 3 clinical trials have undergone rigorous evaluation and examination by independent safety monitoring boards and have been scrutinized by the strictest regulatory agencies in the world.",1
Healthcare workers must inform patients of the benefits they will receive from getting vaccinated versus developing the immunity from the natural disease. Emphasize that prevention is always better than cure.,1

"Vaccines are assessed to ensure they meet acceptable standards of quality, safety and efficacy using clinical trial data, manufacturing and quality control processes. The assessment weighs the threat posed by the emergency as well as the benefit that would accrue from the use of the product against any potential risks.",1
"Getting vaccinated could save your life. COVID19 vaccines provide strong protection against serious illness, hospitalization and death. There is also some evidence that being vaccinated will make it less likely that you will pass the virus on to others, which means your decision to get the vaccine also protects those around you.",1
" COVID19 vaccines are highly effective, but some people will still get ill from COVID19 after vaccination.",1
There is also still a chance that you could also pass the virus on to others who are not vaccinated.,1
"WHO recommends that while vaccine supply is limited, the people at highest risk of COVID19 are vaccinated first. This includes people who are more likely to get severe disease if they are infected older persons and people with existing health conditions and people who are more likely to be exposed to the virus such as health workers.",1
"People who are pregnant have a higher risk of serious illness and preterm birth if they are infected with COVID19, so WHO recommends that they are also prioritized for vaccination, once the first priority groups have been vaccinated.",1
"WHOauthorized COVID19 vaccines are safe for most people of 18 years and older, including those with preexisting conditions of any kind such as autoimmune disorders.",1
The Pfizer vaccine can be safely administered to children from 5 years of age. Both Moderna and Pfizer vaccines are licensed for use in children from 12 years of age. ,1
Vaccine trials for the use of other COVID19 vaccines in children and adolescents are ongoing and WHO will update its recommendations when the evidence or epidemiological situation justifies a change in policy.,1
Children and adolescents above 5 years of age with comorbidities that put them at significantly higher risk of serious COVID19 may be offered vaccination alongside other high priority groups.,1
"WHO recommends that countries should vaccinate healthy children only when high vaccine coverage with two doses has been achieved in higher priorityuse groups, as identified in the WHO Prioritization Roadmap.",1
you should NOT be vaccinated if you have a fever over 38.5C on the day of your vaccine appointment. Postpone until you have recovered.,1
you should NOT be vaccinated if you currently have confirmed or suspected COVID19. Wait until you have completed the mandated isolation period and your acute symptoms have passed to get vaccinated.,1
"COVID19 vaccines are safe for people taking blood thinners, but you should let the person giving you the vaccine know about any medication you are taking BEFORE you are given the vaccine.",1
Each vaccine may have specific considerations for specific populations and health conditions. Talk to your doctor for advice about your specific situation. ,1
"Even if you have already had COVID19, you should be vaccinated. The protection that someone gains from having COVID19 will vary greatly from person to person.",1
The immunity people get from being vaccinated after having a natural infection is consistently very strong. Getting vaccinated even if you have had COVID19 means you are more likely to be protected for longer.,1
There is currently no evidence to determine the optimal time that you should wait to be vaccinated after having COVID19.,1
Persons with laboratoryconfirmed COVID19 infection can consider delaying vaccination for 6 months based on the fact that natural infection leads to some protection against infection. Ask your health worker for advice.  ,1
"All vaccines with WHO Emergency Use Listing are highly effective at preventing serious illness, hospitalization and death due to COVID19. You should accept the vaccine you are offered first and get vaccinated as soon as it is your turn to reduce your risk.",1
"Do not delay getting vaccinated, unless advised to by your health care provider, as this could put you at risk of COVID19. Getting vaccinated could save your life.",1
"In April 2020, WHO published the minimum criteria for how effective COVID19 vaccines should be to make them useful for fighting COVID19. All current vaccines authorized by WHO meet these criteria. To fully understand how effective different vaccines are, we need more real world data. This will come as more people are vaccinated.",1
The best COVID19 vaccine is the one available to you soonest.,1
"COVID19 vaccines are an important tool to stop the pandemic, but they will not do so on their own.",1
"The impact of COVID19 vaccines on the pandemic will depend on several factors. These include the effectiveness of the vaccines how quickly they are approved, manufactured, and delivered the possible development of other variants, and how many people get vaccinated.",1
WHOauthorised COVID19 vaccines have been safely given to billions of people.,1
It is much safer to get vaccinated than it is to risk getting COVID19. Get vaccinated as soon as its your turn and keep doing everything you can to protect yourself and others.,1
"In general, the COVID19 vaccines are very effective at preventing serious illness, hospitalization and death from all current virus variants. They are less effective at protecting you against infection and mild disease than they were for earlier virus variants but if you do get ill after being vaccinated, your symptoms are more likely to be mild.",1
"Remember that while the COVID19 vaccines authorised by WHO are incredibly effective at reducing your risk of developing serious illness and death, no vaccine is 100% effective.",1
A small percentage of people will still get ill from COVID19 even though they have been vaccinated.,1
Scientists around the world are continuing to develop many potential vaccines for COVID19. These vaccines are all designed to teach the bodys immune system to safely recognize and block the virus that causes COVID19.,1
Inactivated or weakened virus vaccines are vaccines that use a form of the virus that has been inactivated or weakened so it doesnt cause disease but still generates an immune response.,1
Proteinbased vaccines are vaccines that use harmless fragments of proteins or protein shells that mimic the COVID19 virus to safely generate an immune response.,1
Viral vector vaccines use a safe virus that cannot cause disease but serves as a platform to produce coronavirus proteins to generate an immune response.,1
"RNA and DNA vaccines, a cuttingedge approach that uses genetically engineered RNA or DNA to generate a protein that itself safely prompts an immune response.",1
"If you can, get your second or third dose with the same vaccine you received for your first dose.",1
"In situations where a second dose of AstraZeneca is not available, WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts SAGE has stated that a second dose of Pfizer or Moderna can be used.",1
There is some evidence that people who receive one dose of AstraZeneca followed by a dose of Pfizer or Moderna have a higher likelihood of mild side effects.,1
"People over 60 who have received two doses of Sinovac and Sinopharm can also be given a third dose to help boost their immunity, once a high level of coverage has been achieved of the priority groups. SAGE has stated that Pfizer or AstraZeneca can also be used for the third dose, if the original vaccine is not available.",1
"Like with any vaccine, some people will experience mild to moderate side effects after being vaccinated against COVID19. This is a normal sign that the body is developing protection.",1
"Side effects to COVID19 vaccines include a fever, tiredness, headache, muscle ache, chills, diarrhoea and pain or redness at the injection site. Not everyone will experience side effects.",1
"Most side effects go away within a few days on their own. You can manage any side effects with rest, plenty of nonalcoholic liquids and taking medication to manage pain and fever, if needed.",1
"If you are worried that the side effects that you are experiencing are unusual, if the pain in the arm where you got the injection gets worse after 24 hours or your side effects dont go away in a few days, contact your healthcare provider for advice.",1
"More serious or longlasting side effects to COVID19 vaccines are possible but extremely rare. If you experience difficulty breathing, chest pain, confusion, loss of speech or mobility after your vaccine, contact your healthcare provider immediately. Vaccines are continually monitored for as long as they are in use to detect and respond to rare adverse events.",1
"The vaccine stimulates your immune system to protect you from the virus. This process can sometimes cause side effects like fever, chills or headache, but not everyone will experiences any side effect. The presence or magnitude of the reaction you may have vaccination does not predict or reflect your immune response to the vaccine.",1
You do not have to have side effects in order to be protected.,1
"If you are worried about your side effects, contact your healthcare provider and let them know about your recent vaccination. ",1
"As with any vaccine, it is essential to closely monitor the safety and effectiveness of COVID19 vaccines that are used in immunization programmes. If a serious health problem is reported following vaccination, a thorough investigation should take place by the public health programme in the country.",1
"Health problems following vaccination are most often found to be coincidental and entirely unrelated to vaccination. Sometimes they are related to how the vaccine has been stored, transported, or administered.",1
It is rare to find that health problems occurring following receipt of a vaccine are actually caused by the vaccine itself. ,1
"The maximum level of protection from COVID19 vaccines is not reached until several weeks after full vaccination. If you have a twodose vaccine, this means that you dont get full immunity until 2  4 weeks after the second dose. You can still become infected and ill during this time.",1
"Breakthrough infections can happen with every vaccine, and do not mean that the vaccine does not work.",1
"According to data from the US CDC, unvaccinated people are at 11 times the risk of death from COVID19 than vaccinated people. ",1
"People who get COVID19 after being vaccinated are much more likely to only experience mild symptoms efficacy against serious illness and death remains high. Get vaccinated, as soon as its your turn.",1
There is some evidence that being fully vaccinated can prevent infection with the COVID19 virus. This means that being vaccinated is likely to help protect people around you by making it less likely that you will pick up the virus and pass it on.,1
"Even after getting vaccinated, keep taking precautions to protect yourself, family and friends if there is still COVID19 in your area.",1
The maximum level of protection is not reached until several weeks after full vaccination. ,1
"COVID19 vaccines are highly effective, but a small percentage of people will still get ill from COVID19 after vaccination this is known as a breakthrough infection. ",1
current data indicates that most people have strong protection against serious illness and death for at least 6 months.,1
"Immunity may reduce faster in people who are older or who have underlying medical conditions, or who have a high level of exposure to the virus. To protect yourself, get vaccinated AND continue practicing the other protective behaviours against COVID19.",1
"People with compromised immune systems dont always develop maximum immunity against COVID19 after one or two doses, so may need an additional dose to protect them.",1
WHO recommends that people who are moderately or severely immunocompromised should be offered an additional dose of COVID19 vaccine.,1
"For Sinovac and Sinopharm, WHO recommends that countries should consider offering a third dose of the vaccine to the vaccination schedule for those aged 60 and over as an extension of the primary series, once a high level of coverage of first and second doses has been achieved in the priority groups.",1
An additional dose is different from a booster dose. It is considered part of an extended primary series for people who do not develop sufficient protection after one or two doses. It is intended to help these individuals to develop better protection against COVID19. ,1
"A booster dose is an additional dose of vaccine administered to a vaccinated population that has completed a primary vaccination series currently one, two or three doses of COVID19 vaccine depending on the vaccine and the population group when, with time, the immunity and clinical protection has fallen below a rate deemed sufficient in that population.",1
"The current primary goal of immunization in the COVID19 pandemic remains to protect people against hospitalization, severe disease and death.",1
" COVID19 vaccine will not cause a positive test result for a COVID19 PCR or antigen laboratory test. This is because the tests check for active disease and not whether an individual is immune. However, because the COVID19 vaccine prompts an immune response, it may be possible to test positive in an antibody serology test that measures COVID19 immunity in an individual.",1
"WHO does not support using proof of vaccination as a requirement for international travel. This would not be fair, given that there are not enough vaccines for everyone, and that some countries have more access to vaccines than others. ",1
"There is no known influence or interaction between antibiotics and COVID19 vaccines. If you are prescribed antibiotics by a health professional before or after your vaccination, you should go ahead and take the full course.",1
"if you have a temperature over 38.5 C at the time of your vaccination appointment, you should reschedule for when you feel better.",1
"There is no evidence that the safety or effectiveness of COVID19 vaccines is affected by anything you eat or drink before or after getting vaccinated, including alcohol.",1
"drinking alcohol can add to the normal mild to moderate side effects that you might experience after vaccination, such as a headache and tiredness. Because of this, it is advisable to avoid drinking until any side effects following vaccination have passed",1
"WHO recommends that children aged 5 and above with comorbidities that put them at significant risk of severe COVID19 should be offered vaccination, at a reduced dosage, alongside other highrisk groups.",1
"WHO strongly recommends that countries should vaccinate children only when high vaccine coverage with primary vaccination series has been achieved in higher priorityuse groups, as identified in the WHO Prioritization Roadmap.",1
Most children are at low risk of serious disease and vaccinating them would be primarily about reducing transmission.,1
you can get vaccinated if you are pregnant. ,1
There is no current evidence that suggests the COVID19 vaccines interfere with fertility. ,1
There is currently no biological evidence that antibodies from COVID19 vaccination or vaccine ingredients could cause any problems with reproductive organs.,1
you should get vaccinated if you are planning to get pregnant.,1
 Getting vaccinated is the best thing you can do to protect yourself and the future health of your baby. ,1
"If you are breastfeeding, you should get vaccinated against COVID19 as soon as it is your turn. None of the current COVID19 vaccines have live virus in them. This means there is no risk of you transmitting COVID19 to your baby through your breastmilk from the vaccine.  In fact, the antibodies you get after vaccination may go through your breast milk and help to protect your baby. ",1
"You should get vaccinated if you are menstruating. If you have your period on the day of your vaccination appointment, you can go ahead and get vaccinated. Menstruation isnt a medical reason to not get the COVID19 vaccine. If you have concerns or questions about your periods, do not hesitate to speak with your health care provider.",1
"Many of the most advanced vaccines have included a small number of people living with HIV. Despite limited data, available information suggests COVID19 vaccines for which WHO has issued recommendations, are safe for people living with HIV.",1
" The vaccines often include genetic material from SARSCoV2, but do not contain the whole virus, so the virus cannot replicate. As they are not live vaccines, they are not expected to be less safe in people who are immunocompromised. ",1
"No pharmacological interactions have been reported between COVID19 vaccines and antiretroviral drugs people living with HIV should continue to take antiretroviral therapy after vaccination, which maintains health and prevents onward HIV transmission.",1
"It is theoretically possible that people living with HIV with low CD4 cell counts might have a weaker immune response to a vaccine. However, in practice this has not been documented for other vaccines and there is no evidence to support a less robust immune response to COVID19 vaccines among people with low CD4 cell counts.",1
People living with HIV should not be excluded from COVID19 vaccine access plans regardless of their immune status and countries ought to consider including people with HIV in a priority group for COVID19 vaccination according with their epidemiological context.,1
"There are strict precautions in place to help ensure the safety of all COVID19 vaccines. Before receiving validation from WHO and national regulatory agencies for emergency use, COVID19 vaccines must undergo rigorous testing in clinical trials to prove that they meet internationally agreed benchmarks for safety and efficacy.",1
"Unprecedented scientific collaborations have allowed COVID19 vaccine research, development, and authorizations to be completed in record time  to meet the urgent need for these vaccines while maintaining high safety standards.",1
"As with all vaccines, WHO and regulatory authorities will continuously monitor the use of COVID19 vaccines to identify and respond to any safety issues that might arise. Through that process, we ascertain that they remain safe for use around the world.",1
"The vaccines must be proven safe and effective in large Phase III clinical trials. Some COVID19 vaccine candidates have already completed their Phase III trials and are being used globally, and many other vaccine candidates are being developed and are still in the trial phase.",1
"Independent reviews of the efficacy and safety evidence are required by WHO for each vaccine candidate, including regulatory review and approval in the country where the vaccine is manufactured, before WHO considers it for emergency use listing.",1
"The WHOs Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety GACVS monitors how approved vaccines behave in the real world and to identify any signals of adverse events following immunization. GACVS is an independent group of experts providing authoritative, scientific advice to WHO on vaccine safety issues of global or regional concern.",1
"Vaccine safety monitoring is critical at national, regional, and global levels. After any vaccine is introduced, WHO works with vaccine manufacturers, health officials, national advisory committees and other partners to monitor for any safety concerns on an ongoing basis. Specific safety concerns that arise are then evaluated by WHO and an independent group of experts the Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety, or GACVS in conjunction with the relevant national authorities.",1
"As is standard practice in all national immunization programmes, WHO is supporting the implementation of safety monitoring systems for COVID19 vaccines in every country.",1
Suspected safety events officially reported to WHO go through a series of rapid verification steps involving the Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety GACVS. WHO then shares the results of these evaluations on its website and publishes the results of any assessments.,1
"WHO also coordinates with local, regional, and national health officials to investigate vaccine safety concerns and advise on next steps.",1
"Additional vaccine safety information is also made available through the Vaccine Safety Net, a global network of websites providing reliable information on vaccine safety that have been verified by WHO.",1
"In rare situations where a serious adverse reaction is suspected to be related to the vaccine itself, the vaccine may be temporarily suspended from use while the situation is assessed. Investigations will take place to determine what exactly caused the event, and corrective measures will be put in place.",1
"WHO works closely with vaccine manufacturers, health officials, researchers, and other partners to monitor any safety concerns and potential side effects.",1
"It is safe for you to receive two different COVID19 vaccines for your first and second dose. This is sometimes called mixing and matching vaccines, or a heterologous vaccine schedule. WHO considers two doses of any WHO EUL COVID19 vaccines to be a complete primary series. ",1
Women can receive a vaccine at any point in their menstrual cycle. ,1
"The COVID19 mRNA vaccine technology has been rigorously assessed for safety, and clinical trials have shown that mRNA vaccines produce an immune response that has high efficacy against disease. mRNA vaccine technology has been studied for several decades, including in the contexts of Zika, rabies, and influenza vaccines. mRNA vaccines are not live virus vaccines and do not interfere with human DNA.",1
"Globally, mRNA vaccines such as Pfizer and Moderna have been used to protect millions of people against COVID19. A significant amount of data is available from both clinical trials and country surveillance programmes on their efficacy and safety. Some mild side effects are expected after vaccination these are a normal sign that the body is developing protection.",1
"COVID19 vaccines have proven to be safe, effective and lifesaving. Like all vaccines, they do not fully protect everyone who is vaccinated, and  we do not yet know how well they can prevent people from transmitting the virus to others. So as well as getting vaccinated, we must also continue with other measures to fight the pandemic.",1
"All COVID19 vaccines approved by WHO for emergency use listing have been through randomized clinical trials to test their quality, safety and efficacy.",1
"To be approved, vaccines are required to have a high efficacy rate of 50% or above. After approval, they continue to be monitored for ongoing safety and effectiveness.",1
A vaccines efficacy is measured in a controlled clinical trial and is based on how many people who got vaccinated developed the outcome of interest usually disease compared with how many people who got the placebo dummy vaccine developed the same outcome.,1
"Once the study is complete, the numbers of sick people in each group are compared, in order to calculate the relative risk of getting sick depending on whether or not the subjects received the vaccine. From this we get the efficacy  a measure of how much the vaccine lowered the risk of getting sick.",1
"If a vaccine has high efficacy, a lot fewer people in the group who received the vaccine got sick than the people in the group who received the placebo.",1
Vaccine effectiveness is a measure of how well vaccines work in the real world. Effectiveness is measured by observing how well the vaccines work to protect communities as a whole.,1
"Vaccines offer strong protection, but that protection takes time to build. People must take all the required doses of a vaccine to build full immunity.",1
"For twodose vaccines, vaccines only give partial protection after the first dose, and the second dose increases that protection. It takes time before protection reaches its maximum level a few weeks after the second dose.",1
"For a onedose vaccine, people will have built maximum immunity against COVID19 a few weeks after getting vaccinated. ",1
"Vaccines can stop most people from getting sick with COVID19, but not everyone.",1
"Even after someone takes all of the recommended doses and waits a few weeks for immunity to build up, there is still a chance that they can get infected. Vaccines do not provide full 100% protection, so breakthrough infections  where people get the virus, despite having been fully vaccinated  will occur. ",1
"If vaccinated people do get sick, they are likely to have milder symptoms, in general 'It is very rare for someone vaccinated to experience severe illness or die.",1
"COVID19 vaccines are crucial tools in the pandemic response and protect against severe disease and death. Vaccines provide at least some protection from infection and transmission, but not as much as the protection they provide against serious illness and death.",1
"After being vaccinated, individuals should continue taking simple precautions, such as physical distancing, wearing a mask, keeping rooms well ventilated, avoiding crowds, cleaning hands, and coughing into a bent elbow or tissue. Get tested if you are sick, even if youve been vaccinated.",1
"vaccines are proving effective against existing variants, especially at preventing severe disease, hospitalization and death. However, some variants are having a slight impact on the ability of vaccines to guard against mild disease and infection.",1
"Vaccines are likely staying effective against variants because of the broad immune response they cause, which means that virus changes or mutations are unlikely to make vaccines completely ineffective.",1
All COVID19 vaccines approved for emergency use listing by WHO have been thoroughly tested and proven to provide a high degree of protection against serious illness and death.,1
"As stronger virus variants emerge, its important to take your vaccine when its your turn",1
"Vaccination is one of the best ways to prevent diseases. In total, vaccines are estimated to save between 2 and 3 million lives every year.",1
"Together with governments, vaccines manufacturers, scientists and medical experts, WHO's vaccine safety programme is constantly helping monitor the safety of vaccines. This helps ensure that vaccines are safe for you and your family.",1
"Vaccines train our immune system to recognize the targeted virus and create antibodies to fight off the disease without getting the disease itself. After vaccination, the body is ready to fight the virus if it is later exposed to it, thereby preventing illness.",1
People who have already been infected with SARSCoV2 should still get vaccinated unless told otherwise by their health care provider.,1
"Even if youve had a previous infection, the vaccine acts as a booster that strengthens the immune response. There have also been some instances of people infected with SARSCoV2 a second time, which makes getting vaccinated even more important.",1
"Medical professionals can best advise individuals on whether or not, and when, they should receive a vaccine. A health worker will administer the vaccine, and the person receiving it will be asked to wait for 1530 minutes before leaving the vaccination site. This is so that health workers can observe individuals for any unexpected reactions following vaccination.",1
"Like any vaccine, COVID19 vaccines can cause mildtomoderate side effects, such as a lowgrade fever or pain or redness at the injection site. These should go away on their own within a few days.",1
"For some COVID19 vaccines, two doses are required. Its important to get the second dose if the vaccine requires two doses.",1
"For vaccines that require two doses, the first dose presents antigens  proteins that stimulate the production of antibodies  to the immune system for the first time. Scientists call this priming the immune response.",1
"The second dose acts as a booster, ensuring the immune system develops a memory response to fight off the virus if it encounters it again.",1
"Because of the urgent need for a COVID19 vaccine, initial clinical trials of vaccine candidates were performed with the shortest possible duration between doses. Therefore an interval of 2128 days 34 weeks between doses is recommended by WHO. Depending on the vaccine, the interval may be extended for up to 42 days  or even up to 12 weeks for some vaccines  on the basis of current evidence.",1
There are many COVID19 vaccines being developed and produced by different manufacturers around the world. WHO recommends that a vaccine from the same manufacturer be used for both doses if you require two doses. This recommendation may be updated as further information becomes available.,1
"COVID19 vaccines protect against the SARSCoV2 virus only, so its still important to keep yourself healthy and well.",1
"Experiencing side effects after getting vaccinated means the vaccine is working and your immune system is responding as it should. Vaccines are safe, and getting vaccinated will help protect you against COVID19.",1
Individuals should alert their local health providers following vaccination if they experience any unexpected side effects or other health events  such as side effects lasting more than three days.,1
"National authorities and international bodies, including WHO, are closely monitoring for any unexpected side effects following COVID19 vaccine use.",1
Common and mild or moderate side effects are a good thing they show us that the vaccine is working. Experiencing no side effects doesnt mean the vaccine is ineffective. It means everybody responds differently.,1
"Vaccines are designed to give you immunity without the dangers of getting the disease. Its common to experience some mildtomoderate side effects when receiving vaccinations. This is because your immune system is instructing your body to react in certain ways it increases blood flow so more immune cells can circulate, and it raises your body temperature in order to kill the virus.",1
